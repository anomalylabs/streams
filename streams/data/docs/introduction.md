## About Streams

Streams focuses on less is more, freedom of choice, and bubbling up fundamental information about your data.

Streams features:

- Sonic speed.
- An intuitive, user-friendly control panel for data management, content management and administrative tasks.
- The NoSQL flat-file first approach to data modeling also supports various sources like Eloquent using a consistent querying and attribute interface.
- A non-opinionated, purist front-end development supported by native JS components and baked-in API.
- Composer distributed, tested, and documented addons and extended community addon ecosystems.

## Technically Speaking

Streams is a self-hosted PHP 7 starter application using [Streams Core](docs/core/introduction) and [Streams UI](docs/ui/introduction) built on Laravel 7. It defaults to flat-file but can connect to anything for data and content storage. It has built-in support for all Laravel databases. Naturally, templating is powered by Blade.
