// Introduce myself
Hi! My name is [Ryan Thompson](https://ryanthepyro.com/). I am the creator of PyroCMS 3 and Streams. PyroCMS is an ambitious Laravel CMS based around a singular/universal concept of data-modeling that was embedded into Laravel's Eloquent models.

The Streams Platform powering PyroCMS under the hood and providing the majority of it's core functionality along with it's addon layer is far the favorite aspect of PyroCMS. Streams 2 is now a standalone project.

Streams 2 is the CMS destroyer. Database optional. Flat-file default. Version controlled. Wicked fast. Lightweight and easy to pickup and use. Data-source agnostic. Massively extensible. Highly configurable. Purist Laravel. Optional control panel and input interface. Open source.

It is my vision to provide individuals and development teams with game changing tools and capabilities which they can use to build and maintain elegant, sophisticated, and high-performance Laravel applications faster.

By becoming a sponsor, you will help ensure the future success of these projects and my core initiative. I will also give you a warm public shoutout on all the social medias, and will list you with our other sponsors below.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
