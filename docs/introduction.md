- **Intro:** 
    - A highly extensible, code-configured, data-first approach to generating and building high-quality Laravel applications.
- **Explaination:**
    - The Streams platform uses the structure of your data to help you build Laravel applications faster. In some cases you can even generate much of your application.
    - Technically Speaking:
        - Streams is a self-hosted PHP 7 application, built as packages for [Laravel](https://laravel.com).
        - Templating is of course powered by Blade. 
        - Streams enhances and extends the concepts of Laravel.
        - While Streams simplifies interfacing with Laravel, it is highly encouraged to familiarize yourself with how the technology works at the framework level.
        - Streams utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. Before using Streams, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. If you are new to Composer, no worries! We will guide you on how to use it to manage your Streams project.
