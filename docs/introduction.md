Streams is a rediculously flexible, developer _and_ user-friendly platform built as a few Laravel packages. You can use it for creating bespoke digital products and experiences for the web.

#### It features:

- An intuitive, user-friendly, and lightning fast control panel and UI system for data management and administrative tasks.
- A clean-slate approach to data modeling and front-end development that doesnâ€™t make any assumptions about your data or how it should be used, managed, or consumed.
- A composer-powered addon system with free and commercial addons.
- A full featured and standardized REST API.
- Painless service integration and streamlined building experience for addon developers.
- An active, diverse, die-hard community.

## Technically Speaking
        
Streams is a self-hosted PHP 7 application, built as packages for [Laravel](https://laravel.com). Templating is of course powered by Blade.
