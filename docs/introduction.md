The Streams platform is a new bread of CMS. We call it a (DMS) data management system. Streams is abstracted into a few core packages so you can choose your own adventure and keep your project tight.

## Principle Concerns

The Streams platform focuses on these fundamental areas of application development.

- [Data Modeling](streams)
- [Laravel Enhancement](core)
- [Frontend Development](frontend)
- [User Interface](ui)
- [API Readiness](api)

## Use Cases

The Streams platform can be used to build darn-near anything you can think of with Laravel, only faster.
