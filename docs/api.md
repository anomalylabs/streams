Introduce API package and link to it's introduction OR even render nav here?

This would be like the "Docs" landing page but for API specifically. Kinda.

- Introduction
- Explanation
    - This part will be easy as well. Much to say, but what's MOST IMPORTANT?
    - Defaults to everything and easy to customize / format / reduce overhead
