## About Streams

The Streams Platform enables developers to quickly build Laravel applications by leveraging basic code-configured information about the application's data structure.

## Streams Features

- Outstanding speed and performance.
- An intuitive, user-friendly control panel for resource management and administrative tasks.
- A NoSQL flat-file first approach to data modeling that supports various sources like Eloquent using a consistent querying and attribute interface.
- A non-opinionated, purist front-end development supported by native JS components and baked-in API.
- Composer distributed, tested and documented add-ons and extended community add-on ecosystems.

## Technically Speaking

Streams is a self-hosted PHP 7 starter application using [Streams Core](docs/core/introduction) and [Streams UI](docs/ui/introduction) built on Laravel 7. It defaults to flat-file but can connect to anything for data and content storage using a simple, consistent API. It has built-in support for all Laravel databases. Naturally, templating is powered by Blade.
