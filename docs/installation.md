## Downloading Streams

<!-- ### Via Starter Project

- [Example](https://github.com/anomalylabs/example) -->

### Via Composer Create-Project

```bash
composer create-project anomaly/streams example.local --prefer-dist --stability=dev
```

### Local Development Server

If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development server to serve your application, you may use the `serve` Artisan command. This command will start a development server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Installing Streams

Just kidding; there is no installation. You are all done here.

## Existing Laravel Projects

You can add the Streams platform to existing Laravel projects by requiring the packages you need.

#### Requiring Packages

The `core` package is responsible for the meat and taters; it is the only **required** package.

```bash
composer require anomaly/streams-platform
```

To include UI features:

```bash
composer require anomaly/streams-ui
```

To include API features:

```bash
composer require anomaly/streams-api
```

#### Update Composer Scripts

This step is **optional**. You may find it helpful to compare our default `scripts` below to your own and decide what you would like to include.

```bash
// composer.json
"scripts": {
    "pre-autoload-dump": [
        "rm -Rf bootstrap/cache/*.php"
    ],
    "post-autoload-dump": [
        "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
        "@php artisan package:discover --ansi",
        "@php artisan clear --ansi",
        "@php artisan vendor:publish --ansi --tag=public",
        "@php artisan queue:restart --ansi"
    ],
    "post-root-package-install": [
        "@php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\""
    ],
    "post-create-project-cmd": [
        "@php artisan key:generate --ansi"
    ]
}
```


## Updating
From within your project, use Composer to update individual packages:

```bash
composer update anomaly/streams-platform --with-dependencies
```

```bash
composer update anomaly/streams-ui --with-dependencies
```

```bash
composer update anomaly/streams-api --with-dependencies
```

You can, of course, update your entire project using `composer update`.
