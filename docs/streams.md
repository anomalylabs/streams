Talk about the data layer and how it works and link to it's introduction OR even render nav here?

This would be like the "Docs" landing page but for UI specifically. Kinda.

    - You can easily change the natural cascade of behavior from your Stream definitions any way you please with slightly more configuration detail, adapters, and PHP code for fundamental business logic.
