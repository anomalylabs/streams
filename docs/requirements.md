- **Intro:** 
    - Streams does more with less.
- **Explaination:**
    - This page will go over technical, server, and developer requirements for using Streams.
- **Sections/Features:**
    - Tech Specs
        - Streams is a self-hosted PHP 7 application, designed as [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) packages for [Laravel](https://laravel.com).
        - Templating is of course powered by Blade. 
    - Server Requirements
        - Same as laravel
        - Supported Image Libraries
            - The following libraries are supported for [Image](docs/streams/images) support:
                - GD Library (>=2.0)
                - Imagick PHP extension (>=6.5.7)
    - Developer Requirements
        - The frontend is yours
            - Point out how that means you can buy / use any template easily
        - Streams enhances and extends the concepts of Laravel. While Streams simplifies interfacing with Laravel, it is highly encouraged (though not required) to familiarize yourself with how the technology works at the framework level.
        - Streams utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. Before using Streams, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. If you are new to Composer, no worries! We will guide you on how to use it along the way.
