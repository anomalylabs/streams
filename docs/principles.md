## Fundamental Values

#### Minimum Effective Input

What is the minimum amount of information to effectively convey an idea? Our core developers spend a lot of time reducing problems down to their fundamental components in order to better understand them as a whole and form solutions to answer that very question for all aspect of the Streams platform.

#### Data First

The Streams platform starts with, and often stays very close to, the domain-objects involved with your application. 

#### Rediculous Flexibility
- An intuitive and lightning fast control panel for data management and administrative tasks.
- A clean-slate approach to data modeling and front-end development that doesnâ€™t make any assumptions about your data or how it should be used, managed, or consumed.
- A composer-powered addon system with free and commercial addons.
- A full featured and standardized REST API.
- Painless service integration and streamlined building experience for addon developers.
- An active, diverse, die-hard community.
