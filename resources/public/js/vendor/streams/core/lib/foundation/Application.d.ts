/**
 * The main application has some similarity to laravel.
 *
 * - IoC Container
 * - Registers and boots Service Providers to provide a easy way into the application cycle and access to the IoC container
 * - The global event thread. Event listeners and dispatchers etc
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *  1. bootstrap()
 *  - This will take all the given providers and loop trough them, by loading and registering them with calling their (if existing) register function.
 *    That's the place to make bindings into the container, start event listeners, read/write cookies and local storage.
 *  - The given configuration will be sorted here
 *  - Once done it'll return a promise with the instance of the Application
 *
 *  2. boot()
 *  - This will take all the given providers and loop trough them, by loading and registering them with calling their (if existing) boot function.
 *    Additional operations can now take place because all bindings should be set
 *  - Once done it'll return a promise with the instance of the Application
 *
 *  3. start()
 *  - Starts the application. Currently based on Vue, but can just as well be for anything other then that.
 *
 *  So an simple example of what a Service Provider looks like {@see StreamsServiceProvider}
 * })
 *
